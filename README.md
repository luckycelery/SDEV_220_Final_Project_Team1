# Animal-Shelter-Pet-Tracker
This repository is dedicated to a SDEV220 collaborative final project to create a functional Python GUI for a business/non-profit

*** 
For use, please run the program through the "Animal_Shelter_Pet_Tracker.py" file found in the "final_program_code" folder.
Images are also included in the "sample_images" folder to ensure functionality with sample data that is pre-saved into the designated json file.
Users are able to add their own animals and images to the json file and perform searches successfully.
